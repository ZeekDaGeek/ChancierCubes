# ChancierCubes
Backports and adds ChanceCube rewards, originally created with compatibility of GT: New Horizons (1.7.10) in mind.

Created with [GTNewHorizons' ExampleMod](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/ExampleMod1.7.10). All of the automated actions and gradle scripts are theirs.

## Dependencies
 - ChanceCubes: https://github.com/TheTurkeyDev/ChanceCubes

## Skeleton
This mod should be usable as a skeleton in the event that you want to make your own custom ChanceCube rewards with more than what the JSON methods will allow.
